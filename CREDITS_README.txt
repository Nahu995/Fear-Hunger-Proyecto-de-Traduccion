DISCORD

Jacob Hunt
Moderator/dungeon masters/general help
Kill_Switch-X/Isayah, chilly, The Sandman, Chato

The game was made with RPG MAKER MV that
is developed by KADOKAWA and Yoji Ojima. 
RPG Maker is published by Degica.


Thanks to everyone who has been supporting the 
development of the game for the past two years. There 
are too many names that deserve a mention here that I 
would surely forget some important ones, so let's just 
not mention anyone. A perfect solution. No, but really, 
thank you everyone! The game wouldn't exist without you!


SPECIAL THANKS
The chibi version of the Crow Mauler was based on fanart
made by Vervain @VervainVanity

The character Jeanna was based on orginal character by 
Mom/Fern

The character Seril was based on original character by
Mask

The character Isayah was based on original character by
Kill_Switch-X
